This repository is me implementing a ray tracer in Go by following "The Ray Tracer Challenge" book
* The book is available here: https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/
* The book lays out a language-agnostic TDD plan for implementing a ray tracer from scratch
* I added Go library ebiten to animate the raytracer output to a window
